Gravity Setup

1.  Check it out (you've obviously already done that)
2.  Copy the libraries Zend/ and Doctrine/ to the libraries folder (by unzipping from the zip in docs/)
3.  Open up your sites-available/default file or whatever and type:

    <VirtualHost *:80>
       DocumentRoot "/var/www/[whatevs]/public"
       ServerName gravity.local

       # This should be omitted in the production environment
       SetEnv APPLICATION_ENV development

       <Directory "/var/www/gravity/public">
           Options Indexes MultiViews FollowSymLinks
           AllowOverride All
           Order allow,deny
           Allow from all
       </Directory>

    </VirtualHost>

    Changing the directories where necessary

4.  Add to yours hosts file

        127.0.0.1   whatevs.local

5.  Copy application.ini to application/configs/
6.  Modify application.ini to a local db
7. Execute doctrine orm:schema-tool:create on the command line
8. I 'think' that's it, edit this file if there's someting missing
